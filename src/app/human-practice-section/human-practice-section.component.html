    We decided to combine both integrated and non-integrated human practices in the same page, the two parts being
    linked by a unique story that we wanted to share. We consider as purely integrated human practices the scientific
    video and written discussion with chemists (that work on drug degradation), cancer biologists (that work on drug
    development), and industries that all completely steered our project. As you will see on this page we have several
    discussions and presentation forms (a video, some complete written or shortened interviews, plus the publication of a
    review which sums up all our bibliography work).

    <h1>Overview</h1>
  </div>

  <p>Numerous chemicals are used in health care facilities. However, the consequences of chemical pollution associated with hospital wastewater is not sufficiently taken into consideration: available data on the subject are scarce. As these molecules can eventually find their way into drinking water, their elimination is an important societal issue. </p>

  <p>We wrote a short manuscript that is presently submitted to peer review and will be available on the middle-end of October under the name: “Dégradation d’un médicament dans les eaux usées”,  to inform the French-speaking public about hazards associated with hospital wastewaters and possible treatments, the topic of our project (in the <a
      href="https://www.medecinesciences.org/en/">Medecine-Science journal</a>).</p>

  <p>Furthermore, we assessed the opinions of the general public, and that of physicians and scientists working in
    related
    fields, and consequently steered our project to maximize social utility and acceptability.</p>

  <p>As a GMO-based solution, the real-life deployability of our project was dependant on observance of European and
    French
    standards concerning the use of modified bacteria. We integrated regulatory compliance from the ground up by
    contacting and interviewing a lawyer specialized in environmental law.</p>

  <p>Our solution may also be of interest to industries specialized in water treatment, as it is a simple system to set
    up,
    inexpensive and generalizable to a broad spectrum of target compounds.</p>

    <h1>Project building</h1>
  </div>

  <p>When we first created our iGEM team, a few team members proposed that we could work on degradation of oestrogens in wastewaters.</p>

  <p>However, this subject was already very popular and had been explored by several iGEM teams. Yet, we realized that if the presence of oestrogen in wastewater was an important environmental issue, then the presence of highly toxic molecules such as anticancer drugs was most likely equally problematic. Many questions came to our minds: could these drugs be degraded and how? Had their presence in wastewater been quantified? Had their potential impact on the environment been evaluated? Was the degradation process included in the drug design process? To answer our many questions we started a long bibliographic work to find as much information as possible.
  </p>
  <p>You can find more informations and references about pharmaceuticals impact in wastewater on <a
    (click)="this.router.navigate(['/background'], { fragment: 'top'})">the Background page</a></p>

  <p>Since the number of reviews on the topic was limited, we decided to address the question and wrote a manuscript to Medecine/Science, a French journal. This review is about the impact of anticancer drugs in wastewater and introduces our project as a potential solution.</p>
  <p>Finally, the limited amount of data available in the literature encouraged us to contact scientists to help us broaden our knowledge on the subject and shape our project.</p>

    <h1>Impact of scientists</h1>
  </div>
  <p>To better frame our project, we contacted several researchers that specifically work on anticancer drug development. We reached 19 scientists to get to know the habits of specialists working with those drugs. It is important to get in contact with researchers because they development cancer treatment of tomorrow. They all came from two of the main European cancer research centers:  the Institut Curie and the Institut Gustave Roussy.</p>

  <p>The 18 first scientists interviewed were mostly researchers (94.1%), one was a health professional and the last one was an engineer. Among them, 47% used cytostatic or cytotoxic drugs (Fig. 1). More precisely, 35% used them less than once a month, 24% used them once or twice a month, and 24% once or twice a week. The other drugs (Immunotherapy, Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors, B-Raf inhibitors) being used less commonly, we thus decided to focus on cytostatic and cytotoxic drugs based on these survey results.</p>

      and the frequency of use.
    </div>
  </mat-card>


  <p>Before choosing any specific drug, we asked these scientists if they took into consideration, during the drug development process, the degradation of the anticancer drugs after their use. Surprisingly, we found out that 47% of them did not consider this step during their research (Fig. 2), while 53% considered it rarely, or sometimes. Thus it appeared that these aspects had not been integrated into development process. Even though most of these scientists confessed that they did not have enough time to really consider this step, 65% of them agreed that it should be taken in consideration during the drug development process. </p>

      researchers
      thinking more time should be spent on the environmental impact of drug degradation during the development phase.
    </div>
  </mat-card>

  <p>Lastly, we asked them if developing an anticancer drug degradation system based on bacteria to treat hospital wastewater could be a solution : 41% thought that it could indeed be a good solution, and another 41% remained uncommitted, which encouraged us to continue developing our concept (Fig. 3).</p>

    <h1>Video interview</h1>
  </div>

  <p>You can find below a video of the interview of Maria Koźlak, a PhD candidate at the Institut Curie who works in the Marie Dutreix team on « DBait molecules/ Reparation, Recombination and Cancer». This video illustrates our typical interview process with researchers.
  </p>

  <div class="normalmargin" style="width: 600px;">

  </div>

  <p>As you can see in the video, Maria shares the same observations as her colleagues. The main anticancer drugs used in the labs are the cytostatic/cytotoxic drugs, and unfortunately scientists do not have time to work on the degradation step during the drug design process. These weeks of investigations reinforced our belief that there is indeed an urge to tackle this major environmental issue. There is a lack of research on degradation of anticancer drugs. No specific method seems to be developed for future cures.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point we heard about methotrexate (MTX). We had a particular interest in this drug because of its uses in
    several diseases. Indeed, it is used to treat cancer as a cytostatic drug but it is also to treat chronic inflammatory
    syndromes such as psoriasis, arthritis, and many others.
  </p>
  <p>
    For sure, a lot of questions remained in our heads. Does the wastewater industry implement specific methods to
    degrade anticancer drugs? Can our type of project (use GMOs to degrade specifically anticancer drugs) have an
    industrial interest?
  </p>

  <div class="titrebloc" id="industry">

    <h1>Confronting our idea to industries</h1>
  </div>


  <p>We met and discussed with the Dr R. Labruère, a scientist in chemistry and researcher at the Paris-Saclay
    University.
    He works on drug elimination in wastewaters. He helped us to create and develop MethotrExit. However, at the end of one discussion he told us that industry would
    not be interested in a treatment that cannot be useful for multiple drugs at once. He advised us to make a specific but
    modular project, a kind of “toolbox” that could degrade a large spectrum of drugs but using only one simple
    method.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s with him that we specifically choose to work on the methotrexate (MTX) as a proof of our concept. Other
    scientists already told us that this drug could be an interesting target. Dr Labruère explained clearly that if not
    treated in the hospital effluents, this drug metabolized into a more harmful molecule. If low doses of MTX already
    impact fish populations with lethal nerve development defects, it is clear how much the 7-OH-MTX, its more active
    metabolite, can be dangerous for the environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    To get a real industrial opinion we asked almost 20 different organizations from all over the world, private or public, all working on wastewater treatments. We struggled a lot to contact them, at the end only one company accepted to help us with our project and to define what was already done in industries. It has to be noted that several companies cut off the discussions when questioned about “anticancerous drug wastewater treatment”. We discussed with a member of the Arvia Technology Company, one of the British leaders in that field. During the exchange and reading the press, we learned that they used an adsorption and electrochemical oxidation method to reduce micropollutants, such as medicines, in wastewaters. This solution is chemicals free and able to reduce the general level of these pharmaceutical micropollutants. However, they explained to our team that, presently, they don’t have a specific solution for the elimination of the most present anticancer drugs into wastewaters such as  methotrexate.
  </p>

  <p>According to Francesco Bregoli from the European Geosciences Union, water contamination by pharmaceutical products could increase by two third until 2050. This is quite alarming and amplifies the emergency of the situation.</p>
  <p>Short talks with practicing nurses, such as Vincent Aubry, who works at the Strasbourg hospital in a unit which is partly treating people suffering from cancer lead us to discover that there are no specific precautions nor protocols for disposal of the excretions of treated patients! Moreover, according to the nurses interviewed, during their studies, no indications of any procedures to isolate patients excretions using anticancer medicines were given. </p>

  <p>To make sure our concept was complete, we still needed to check the legality of MethotrExit.</p>

    <h1>MethotrExit and french laws</h1>
  </div>

  <p>To make sure our project was built respecting the French Laws we interviewed a lawyer Mrs C. Deschamps, lawyer at Paris Bar. Indeed, it is important to make sure that our project is viable, but it is as important to make sure that our project is legal and that we respected the legislation during the building process.</p>
  <p>Moreover, it was also important to talk with this specialized lawyer to understand the hospital obligations in term of pharmaceuticals degradation.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Deschamps explained to us that protecting aquatic ecosystems and humans around these is a very large task
    depending on a lot of different parameters and laws. But most of these laws can be found in the european <i><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32000L0060&from=FR">Directive
      Cadre sur l’Eau</a></i> (DCE), in the french <i><a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006074220">Code de l’Environnement</a></i> and <i><a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072665">Code de la Santé Publique</a></i>, and
    in two different
    guides: the <i><a href="http://www.hautconseildesbiotechnologies.fr/fr/system/files/file_fields/2015/06/30/manuelduconfine.pdf">Guide du Haut Conseil de Biotechnologie</a></i> (HCB) and the <i><a href="https://www.icrc.org/fre/assets/files/publications/icrc-001-4032.pdf">Guide de gestion des déchets hospitaliers</a></i>.</p>
  <p>
    All
    those texts are very important and can not be ignored when building a project like ours. Since 2012, we can observe
    a real evolution on the environmental law, so it is crucial to adapt.</p>

  <p>Here you will find the written interview of Mrs. Deschamps:</p>

  <h2>1. What are the laws for the preservation of aquatic ecosystems in France?</h2>

  <mat-expansion-panel>
    <mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <mat-panel-title>
        Answer
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>

    <p>There is a multiplicity of texts whose objective is the preservation of aquatic ecosystems: the subject is very
      vast.</p>
    <p>That is why we  are going to present a general frame to get a first approach of the regulations that may apply to your project, subject to its precise characteristics. Only definitive specifications and applications for the final device would allow us to be accurate and precise.</p>

    <p>They depend not only on the areas concerned (urban, protected, ...) but also on the nature of the activity, or the nature of the discharges likely to harm the environment. Beyond the preservation of the ecosystem itself, we also aim to preserve the health of people which are also impacted by the environment degradation.</p>

    <p>Besides, we must keep in mind that patients and workers are exposed to these pollutants. That is why we may also find regulation to protect the workers from exposition to pollutants.</p>

    <p>At European level, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000/60 / EC), adopted on October 23, 2000, already
      established a Community framework for the rational management of water and the protection of wetlands with the aim
      of the good ecological status of the water bodies.</p>

    <p>In French law, these rules are essentially contained in the Code of the Environment (CE) and in the Code of
      Public
      Health (CSP). The Environment Code includes a specific section for the preservation of water from the aquatic
      environment, in its book II "Physical Environments", Title 1, "Water and aquatic and marine environments". It is
      for
      the legislative part, articles L210 and L211-1 and following.
    </p>

    <p>This code evolves and laws are taken regularly. For example the Law n ° 2006-1772 of December 30th, 2006 on the
      water and the aquatic environments and the Law n ° 2016-1888 of December 28th, 2016 of modernization, development
      and protection of mountain territories, or the ordinance n ° 2017-80 dated on January 26th, 2017 relative to the
      environmental authorization.</p>

    <p>Here is an extract of the Article L214-1:</p>
    <p><i>Sont soumis aux dispositions des articles L. 214-2 à L. 214-6 les installations, les ouvrages, travaux et
      activités
      réalisés à des fins non domestiques par toute personne physique ou morale, publique ou privée, et entraînant des
      prélèvements sur les eaux superficielles ou souterraines, restitués ou non, une modification du niveau ou du mode
      d'écoulement des eaux, la destruction de frayères, de zones de croissance ou d'alimentation de la faune piscicole
      ou
      des déversements, écoulements, rejets ou dépôts directs ou indirects, chroniques ou épisodiques, même non
      polluants.</i>
    </p>
    <p>This article explains that installations, works and activities carried out for non-domestic purposes by any
      natural
      or legal person, public or private, and resulting in withdrawals from superficial or underground water, whether or
      not returned, a change in the level or method of disposal of water the destruction of spawning areas, growth areas
      or feeding grounds for fish fauna or direct or indirect, chronic or episodic spills, discharges, discharges or
      deposits, even if they are not polluting, are subject to precise regulation.
    </p>

    <p>They provide a prior authorization mechanism before any installation, the administrative authority verifies that
      the facilities comply. In particular and in accordance with Article L181-3 of the same Code, authorization may
      only
      be granted if the measures it entails ensure the prevention of dangers or disadvantages for the interests
      mentioned
      in Articles L. 211-1 and L. 511-1, as the case may be.

      The environmental authorization can only be granted if the measures it contains also ensure :

  <h2>2. What are the laws concerning the treatment of wastewater?</h2>


  <mat-expansion-panel>
    <mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <mat-panel-title>
        Answer
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>There are laws for each particular waste type, health facilities emit a wide variety of waste.</p>

    <p>Some are radioactive, others have a significant risk of viral or bacterial infection. For example, what do you do
      with
      an Ebola strain? Radioactive waste? Liquid waste is distinguished by risk category: Radioactive, Infectious,
      Chemical, Combined.</p>


    <p>As for the circuit of the drug, it is also treated according to its cytotoxic dangerousness or not.</p>
    <p>- Liquid waste resulting from the establishment's activities meets the specific regulations
      waste related;</p>
    <p>- The effluents (or wastewater) joining the facility's wastewater collection network and then the collective
      sewage
      system or the receiving environment, comply with the specific regulations concerning the discharge of
      wastewater.</p>

    <p>There are as many specific regulations as  exist different kinds of potential harm related to the product, considering it could be released through what we call domestic effluents.
    </p><p>
      The French CSP and EC impose specific ways to destroy the wastes even before they can reach the domestic wastewater network, and under conditions  that have been authorized (as for instance under Article L1331-10 CSP).</p>
  </mat-expansion-panel>
  <p class="spacemaker"></p>

  <h2>3. Are there any specific laws regarding hospital wastewater?</h2>

  <mat-expansion-panel>
    <mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <mat-panel-title>
        Answer
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>As explained previously there is specific regulation for specific kind of pollution. Hospitals are quite
      particular
      polluters since they produce chemical, radioactive, pharmaceutical and organic pollution, among others.</p>

    <p>Waste management is based on several guiding principles, among which the responsibility of the waste producer
      (Article L. 541-1-1 of the Environment Code (EC)). The so-called "extended producer responsibility" ("EPR")
      sectors
      - which make the producers of certain manufactured products contribute to the treatment of the waste that comes
      from
      these products - are an exception to this principle.</p>


    <p>In order to reach the appropriate sector, waste produced by an establishment follows a typical path. These steps
      correspond to the definition of waste management (Article L.541-1-1 of the EC).</p>

    <p>The management of liquid waste at source must make it possible to limit any risk of water pollution. The chapters
      dedicated to the different types of waste produced in the establishments describe how to achieve the best
      management
      methods (depending on the risk(s) associated with the waste). However, it appears that certain pollution can not
      be
      collected and managed and that they will join the wastewater network of the establishment: it is in particular
      cleaning water premises, rinsing water of some devices laboratories, and so on.</p>

    <p>Liquid waste from establishments is classified as non-domestic wastewater as defined by the EC. They result from the mixing of wastewater from household activities and wastewater from all care and technical and logistic activities. As such, the connection to the collective sewerage system is conditional on the issuance of a prior authorization of a spill (Article L. 1331-10 of the CSP) by the competent authority (ies) in matters of environmental protection.</p>

    <p>The regulation of the sanitation service defines the requirements related to the adoption of the spill authorization. It is limited in time and renewable. It indicates the characteristics that wastewater must present in order to be discharged and the spill monitoring conditions. The results of the periodic control of the prescribed discharges must be transmitted to the collection system manager and the wastewater treatment plant manager, who must in turn transmit them to the water police services once a year.</p>

    <p>The spill authorization may also make the spill conditional on the implementation of appropriate pretreatment (such as screening, degreasing or deoiling).</p>
    <p>In addition, the spill authorization shall, when appropriate, require the establishment to immediately alert the competent authority in the event of an accidental spill.</p>

    <p>The regulation recalls that it is forbidden to introduce into the public sanitation system, among others (Article R. 1331-2 and following of the CSP, Article 13 of the Decree of July 21st, 2015):</p>
    <p>- directly or through building pipelines, any solid, liquid or gaseous, which may be toxic to the environment, to be the cause either of a danger to the operating personnel or to the inhabitants of the buildings connected to the collection system, or of a deterioration of the drainage works and of treatment, either of a hindrance in their operation ;</p>
    <p>-  solid waste (diapers, plastic bags, etc.), included after grinding.</p>

    <p>Depending of their nature, characteristics and risks, wastes should be eliminated or pretreated differently (filtered, incinerated, inactivated…) whether they can be spilled into the public wastewater network or not.</p>

  <h2>4. With regard to drugs and pharmaco-chemical pollutants, are there laws ensuring their specific treatment in
    wastewater?</h2>


  <mat-expansion-panel>
    <mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <mat-panel-title>
        Answer
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>More specifically, when we talk about drugs, we can talk about various treatments, including liquids. They will
      not all have the same toxicity or the same characteristics.</p>
    <p>Waste is therefore classified according to these characteristics.</p>
    <p>Some medicines contain dangerous substances (as defined in article L. 1342-2 of the CSP).</p>

    <p>The circular of the Directorate of Relations at Work (DRT) No. 12 of May 24, 2006 classifies the drugs in the
      category of chemical agents and mentions, within the scope of the regulations on the dangerous chemical reagents,
      the consideration of certain which, although not meeting the criteria for the European classification of dangerous
      substances, may pose a risk to the health or safety of workers.</p>

    <p>As explained in the Guide de gestion des déchets hospitaliers the drugs at the origin of the waste, one distinguishes notably:</p>
    <p>- drugs used in human medicine (or veterinary medicine), non-cytotoxic, non-cytostatic;</p>
    <p>- drugs used in human (or veterinary), cytotoxic and cytostatic medicine;</p>
    <p>- narcotics;</p>
    <p>- drugs used in nuclear medicine (radiopharmaceuticals);</p>
    <p>- drugs used in clinical trials.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:1.3em;"></p>
    <p>All waste from drugs in these facilities includes:</p>
    <p>- pharmaceutical raw materials used for the manufacture of medicinal products and
      preparations;</p>
    <p>- medicines that have become unsuitable for the intended initial use (expired, altered,
      used, partially used, not administered, not used), generated by the establishment, returned by individuals to the
      pharmacy for indoor use or returned by patients during a consultation or hospitalization;</p>
    <p>- single-use medical devices and devices used for the preparation before administration and / or the
      administration
      of drugs (compresses, syringes, needles, solute bags, perfusers, peripheral catheters, central catheters, etc.) or
      incorporating active substances;</p>
    <p>- emptied primary packaging contaminated with drug residues (empty acons, empty vials, etc.);</p>
    <p>- secondary and tertiary instructions and packaging (cartons, etc.).</p>
    <p>"DIMED" means all the above-mentioned wastes, which are hazardous or non-hazardous waste. DIMED management
      methods
      are currently organized mainly in establishments within two sectors: healthcare waste with infectious and similar
      risks and chemically hazardous waste.</p>

    <p>The collection and destruction of UNMs, with the exception of narcotics which are the subject of specific
      management, are governed by Articles R. 4211-24 to R. 4211-31 of the CSP. In application of these articles, the
      Cyclamed association is approved by the public authorities to manage them; Although the PUIs are required to
      collect
      the UNMs free of charge, the collection and processing circuits managed by Cyclamed are organized so far only in
      the
      community pharmacies.</p>

    <p>ancer treatments  are under specific regulation.
    <p>-   They may not be destroyed the same way depending if they are contaminated or not, <b>concentrated or not. For most of them it is admitted that they can be incinerated without major risk for the environment</b>.</p>
    <p>-   Circular No. DHOS/ E4 / DGS / SD7B / DPPR / 2006/58 of February 13, 2006 on the disposal of waste generated by cancer treatments ; DRT Circular No. 12 of May 24, 2006 on the general rules for the prevention of chemical risks and the special rules to be adopted against the risks of exposure to carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic agents for reproduction );</p>
    <p>-   Nevertheless some organic wastes from patients under cancer treatments cannot be collected and will inevitably be spilled into the wastewater network.</p>

  <h2>5. Are hospitals subject to legislation regarding the treatment of organic waste?</h2>
  <p>Yes as we saw previously. Theses organic waste may be polluted themselves: they may potentially be infected by viruses, bacteria or chemicals.
  </p><p>
    Some of them have to be confined and destroyed or inactivated without any possibility to be spilled into the wastewater network considering the health risk (we can keep in mind the Ebola virus hypothesis).</p>
  <p class="spacemaker"></p>

  <h2>6. Do these laws take into account the waste that can be found in wastewater?</h2>

  <p>Yes as we saw previously. Unfortunately, some wastes will inevitably be found in wastewater network as far as we cannot collect them. The point is then to know how to filter and/or destroy these non-collectable wastes.</p>

  <p class="spacemaker"></p>

  <h2>7. Do you have any ideas for filling any legal loopholes or limitations of our project?</h2>
  <mat-expansion-panel>

      <mat-panel-title>
        Answer
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>


    <p>The potential obstacles to your project are double:</p>
    <p>-   First of all, the entity who will use your product has to obtain an authorization to use it as a waste elimination equipment. It has to satisfy security and efficiency standards.</p>
    <p>-   Second of all your project is using GMOs.</p>
    <p>The cultivation and marketing of GMOs on the European territory are mainly governed by two texts: Directive 2001/18 / EC and Regulation 1829/2003, relating to deliberate release (marketing for cultivation or food, clinical trials and field trials). In the context of a contained use (research laboratories, industrial production), GMOs are regulated by Directive 2009/41 / EC.</p>
    <p>In France It is impossible to use or manufacture a GMO without first having a specific authorization. Applications for GMO authorization fall into three broad categories:</p>
    <p>- contained uses permit the use of GMOs for industrial production or research purposes;</p>
    <p>- uses for deliberate release allow their use for marketing purposes (for animal or human food, GMO seeds and plants, veterinary drugs, gene therapy products or non-food products such as cut flowers);</p>
    <p>- some GMOs are not intended for marketing and are part of experiments such as field experiments or biomedical or veterinary research.</p>
    <p>The conditions for authorizing research on genetically modified or genetically modified health products are contained mostly in Public health code, under articles R. 1125-1 and following.</p>
    <p>The general provisions for the control of the use and dissemination of genetically modified organisms are contained into the Environmental code (Art. L. 124-3, Art. L. 531-1 et seq., Art. L. 532-1 et seq., Art. L. 533-1 et seq., Art. L. 534-1, Art. L. 535-1 et seq., Art. L. 536-1 et seq., Art. L. 537-1, Art. D. 531-1 et seq., Art. R. 532-1 et seq., Art. R. 533-1 et seq., Art. R. 536-1 et seq.)</p>
    <p>The rural code and sea fishing also contain specific regulation under articles L. 663-1 et seq., and articles D. 663-1 and s, apart from non-codified texts.</p>

    <p>The competent authority to issue authorizations for the use of GMOs depends on their field of application (agriculture, consumption, health, research), but the Ministry of the Environment is always consulted. Whatever the authorization type requested, an assessment of the potential risks to human health and the environment of the use of the GMO concerned is always carried out beforehand by the High Council for Biotechnology (HCB), which issues an opinion and / or a recommendation depending on the nature of the application for authorization.</p>
    <p>You should ensure that your project will not be an environmental issue by itself, beyond its efficiency.</p>

    <p>In a case of contained use I invite you to read the guide of HCB, which deals in particular with the treatment of the production and waste GMO.</p>

  <h2>8. Legally, what are the risks in the event of a leak in the containment of the bioreactor?</h2>

  <p>It depends on the nature of the risk in case of leak as well as the cause of the leak: is your GMO dangerous for people in case of ingestion? Is it dangerous for an ecosystem and how? (proliferation, toxicity…)</p>
  <p>It is important to remember that penalties are provided for environmental and personal health and safety violations, usually with extremely high fines.</p>
  <p>Waste management is based on several guiding principles, among which the responsibility of the waste producer (Article L. 541-1-1 of the Environment Code (EC)).</p>

  <p class="spacemaker"></p>

  <h2>9. More generally, what do you think of the project itself?</h2>
  <p>This project is a particularly interesting research project. I think you must first and foremost think about protecting your ideas..<br>
    Given its novelty, why not consider a Solleau envelope or a patent, provided that you’ll achieve a specific industrial design ton contain and use the GMOs.
  </p>
  <p class="spacemaker"></p>

  <h2>10. Have you ever heard of something similar?</h2>
  <p>I am far from having your level of knowledge in this field. Your project reminds me of the sanitation of swimming pool waters, for example, by means of certain organisms (micro-algae). Nevertheless your case presents the peculiarity of the genetic modification which seems unique to me.</p>

  <p class="spacemaker"></p>

  <p>As it was developed on the question 4 of the interview, from now only little is mandatory in order to remove pharmaceuticals in hospital effluent. A recent national plan “Pharmaceuticals residue in water” from the French Ministry of Ecology indicates that, according to the actual default in eliminating these drugs into wastewater new economical solution are needed for the future.</p>

  <p>Interviewing specialists and scientist was necessary to build the most suitable concept and caring about the legal aspect was obligatory to make it work.</p>

    <p>At this point, one last question came to our minds, what about the public opinion? Would our project be accepted by society?</p>

  <div class="titrebloc" id="opinion">
    <img class="carretitrepincipal"
         src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fd/T--GO_Paris-Saclay--carretitreprinci.png">
    <h1>Public opinion</h1>
  </div>

  <p>Since we asked a lot of specialists to ensure that our project could work and is legal we also thought that we needed to ask the public if they agreed with our idea. To make a project work, specialists are important but they are not directly the persons that will benefit it. Here, the “consumers” are people who drink tab water. All of society is potentiallt concerned by our idea, it was thus needed to involve public opinion in the MethotrExit building process. </p>

  <p>We developed a survey open to everyone to gather the public’s opinion. 170 persons from all ages and all professions answered to our questionnaire. 90.1% (Fig. 1A) of them admitted taking some medications during the past year. 92.9% of the interviewed people taking some medications (Fig. 1B) took anti-inflammatory drugs (such as paracetamol), 45.5% took antibiotics, 30.3% took birth control pills, 23.2% took antihistamines (and other allergy treatments), and 20.2% followed other treatments (none specified). No one went through heavy treatments such as cancer treatments. </p>

      last year, and percentages of the different drugs taken by the persons in during the last year.
    </div>
  </mat-card>

  <p>Most of them are concerned about the fate (degradation, environmental spreading…) of the drugs they use (60.9%) but
    most of them don’t actually know what the current techniques of drug degradation are (93.5%) and what are the
    impacts
    of drug spreading in the environment (60.4%). These percentages pushed us to sensitize and inform people all around
    us
    and on social networks about our concept and wastewater treatments. Since some of these drugs end up in the tab
    water
    we drink, it is important to warn them and to be sure that our idea can be accepted by the society.</p>

  <p>We asked our panel if they agreed with our projects and if they had comments to make. 85.3% are fine with the use
    of
    GMOs to degrade the anticancer drugs in wastewaters and really encourages the Methotrexit. Whereas, 14.7% do not
    agree
    with our project because nature should not be modified and we cannot ensure the containment of our system.</p>

    <h1>Artistic view</h1>
  </div>

  <p>A French artist, known as Vipallegoria, got inspired by our idea of treating the hospital wastewaters from all
    these
    toxic medicines and made some symbolic drawings. Art is another way to expose a point of view and to send a message
    to
    society. Through these drawings, she wanted to show the gravity of the situation and the urge to do something. This
    is
    an original way to sensitize others to our concept.</p>

    <h1>Conclusion and prospects</h1>
  </div>

  <p>The relevance in society of our idea was a very important motivation for us. We really wanted to develop an idea that could be used by the society and we did our best to make sure that MethotrExit is a viable idea and that people would accept it even though GMOs do not have a good reputation in France.</p>
  <p>At each step of the building process, we strived to integrate the human practice aspect, and made sure to gather some external opinions to continuously improve. Behind the type of used drugs, our modelling to make the easiest adaptable project</p>
  <p>To overcome the lack of data, we decided to write our own article about our project and the different impacts of drugs and anticancer drugs in hospital effluents. We talked with scientists and pharmacists to really shape the project and make sure that it will be useful in the future.</p>
  <p>The contact we had with industries made us expand our field of action by developing a system that can degrade many molecules using one simple pathway instead of just treating one drug. The interview with the lawyer was necessary to make sure that our project can be real and that we are not out of legality. At last, taking in consideration the public’s opinion was obligatory to make sure that people agree with us and that they are concerned about our project. It even inspired an artist to make drawings about MethotrExit !</p>
  <p>Analyzing our results and the different surveys we also thought of ways to extend our project in three main directions after the iGEM contest:</p>
  <p>• the design of a “cleaning factory” usable at home for outpatient, this system would use the HeteroGenious principle but in a smaller containment device so that it could be placed it in the pipings of private houses.</p>
  <p>• the development of a probiotic in the case of a methotrexate overdose. We thought of developing a capsule in which the bacteria would be contained, the drug would enter the device and be degraded, the capsule would then be eliminated in the feces.</p>
  <p>• the use of the ‘HeteroGenious’ expression system we developed for this project, in other strains in which the synthetic pathways of interest are associated to fitness-cost. This could allow the degradation of many other drugs, including oestrogens.</p>
