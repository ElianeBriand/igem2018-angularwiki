    <h1>Plasmid Sketcher at a glimpse</h1>

    <div class="textparagraph">
      Plasmid Sketcher is a <b>web-based software to draw plasmid map</b>.
      In contrast to existing tools, the view is not generated from sequence information, but entirely from user input:
      this allows for non-proportional,
      didactic plasmid map that showcase function over technical precision.
    </div>

    <div class="textparagraph">
      <b>Recommended use</b>: to draw clear plasmid map for communication purpose (proposing a plasmid design,
      illustrating a poster,
      explaining a cloning process …). Use other software for technical operations.
    </div>

    <h1>Inspiration for Plasmid Sketcher</h1>
    <div class="textparagraph">
      Visual communication has long been recognised as an integral part of biology, especially in bacteriology, cell
      biology
      and related disciplines. From the earliest papers, the textual description of restriction site positions,
      cloning protocols or operon structures have given way to the easier-to-grasp graphics we know and love.
    </div>

    <h2>The first plasmid maps</h2>

    <div class="textparagraph">
      <img src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/8/85/T--GO_Paris-Saclay--pbr322_restr.png" class="smallillus">

      The concept of plasmid as transferable genetic material with circular topology emerged slowly. Mapping of plasmid
      took
      off with the discovery of type II restriction enzyme, starting with “endonuclease R” (now known as a mix of HindII
      and HindIII)
      in 1970
      <reference-box shorthand="Loenen2014"></reference-box>
      . The predictable and sequence-dependent cutting allowed
      characterization of fragment and later restriction cloning. Exploring the publication presenting the earliest
      widely-used
      plasmids like ColE1, pSC101 or pBR322, we see plasmids maps that look strikingly modern: except for dated
      typesetting,
      one could draw something similar for one’s publication.
    </div>

    <div class="textparagraph">
      Modern consumer-oriented computers were just starting to appear: these are not the work of a cloning assistant
      software
      like we have today, but more likely custom-made illustration. This is something we wanted to emulate, to have the
      possibility to deviate from one-size-fit-all representations to more streamline figures.

    </div>

    <h2>Visual Language Standardization</h2>

    <div class="textparagraph">
      Some attempts have been made to standardize the visual language of synthetic biology
      <reference-box shorthand="Cox2018"></reference-box>
      , or protein
      domain description
      <reference-box shorthand="Cox2017"></reference-box>
      . Other proposals would use such language as a base for software modelling of
      biological processes
      <reference-box shorthand="Novere2009"></reference-box>
      . With the notable exception of pathway
      modelling, where the existence of exhaustive and widely-used database like KEGG and associated tools like
      CellDesigner
      <reference-box shorthand="Funahashi2003"></reference-box>
      have lead to de facto standardisation, other fields have not widely
      embraced such standardisation attempts.
    </div>
    <div class="textparagraph">

      We hypothesise this is the case because such proposals are not derived from a discipline-wide consultation: the
      normative
      power of these visual languages fails to manifest simply though lack of adoption.
    </div>
    <div class="textparagraph">
      Seen as simply descriptive reviews of visual elements in use, such publication are still worthwhile, and we used
      <reference-box shorthand="Cox2018"></reference-box>
      as inspiration for some elements of our software. We recognize the advantages of having only one
      type of visual representation for each feature, but given the absence of consensus, our software provides a
      variety
      of visual style when possible.
    </div>


    <h2>Putting the map in perspective</h2>
    <div class="textparagraph">

      When analysing implicit goals rather than explicit visual choices, we find that there is a duality of purpose in
      plasmid maps:
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Technical precision</b>: that features are marked exactly, that displayed size are proportional to their
          length.
        </li>

        <li><b>Clear Communication</b>: that the overall purpose and functioning of the system is readily understood.</li>
      </ul>
      These purposes are sometime at odds. Smart compromise may be possible in some cases but not all. In synthetic
      biology, a high-level view is often valuable. Thus we wanted to offer a usable solution fulfilling the second
      identified goal.
    </div>
    <h1>About the software</h1>
    <div class="textparagraph">

      Following the recognized user persona method <reference-box shorthand="Cooper2007"></reference-box>, the interface was designed
      assuming a target audience of scientists or students, having some familiarity with the underlying biological
      concepts.
    </div>
    <h2>Technical considerations</h2>
    <div class="textparagraph">

      The technology used is AngularJS, though there is a will to port it to Angular (“Angular 2.0”). It is based on
      <a href="http://angularplasmid.vixis.com/">Angular Plasmid by Vixis</a> for plasmid visual rendering; and <a href="https://material.angularjs.org/">Google Angular
      Material</a> for UI elements.

      It is an open source software licenced under the GNU GPL v3 or later. <a target="_blank" href="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/b/bf/T--GO_Paris-Saclay--plasmid_sketcher.zip">Source

    <h2>Future features</h2>
    <div class="textparagraph">

      While useable as of now, we plan to add further features, which will be published at the same URL.

      Future features :
      <ul>
        <li>More options for visual representation of features</li>

        <li>Native export to vector format (PDF, SVG)</li>

        <li>Custom CSS loading for in-depth theming</li>

        <li>More shapes for the plasmid circle itself</li>
      </ul>
      And even more !
