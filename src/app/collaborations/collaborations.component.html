    During this 2018 edition, we made fruitful connections with many teams :

    Paris_Saclay is probably the best example of what a real collaboration is. Because our
    team lacked programmers and designers, they proposed to help us with the coding part of IGEM (which really helped us
    in
    creating our wiki), and with the sketching process of our new logo.</p>
  <p>
    We, on the other hand, realised that there was no mathematician in their team. Our two mathematicians proposed to
    work with them on the modelling of their project.

  <p>
    In collaboration with the <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Grenoble-Alpes/Collaborations">IGEM Grenoble Alpes </a>
    team we created the: “Take a famous painting and throw some biology in it
    challenge”. Pictures were posted on social media, the one with the most “likes” wins the competition. A very fun
    challenge indeed, a nice break from the lab during the summer.

  <p>
    We collaborated with <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Duesseldorf/Collaborations">Dusseldorf iGEM steam</a> and we
    participating team designs a postcard which shows an image related
    to synthetic biology (or your topic) on the front and a small informational text on the back. Afterwards each team’s
    postcards are exchanged with other iGEM-teams so that every team can collect postcards from all over the world. The
    received postcards can then be shared with people in the neighbourhood, during public events and so on. We chose to
    put the picture of our challenge in the front, and in the back a brief description of the Grenoble and the GO Paris
    Saclay teams.

    With the help of Sorbonne University and the Bordeaux IGEM team, we organised a Seminar , the 26 of september, about
    synthetic Biology. Aliaa El Dairouty (PHD student in public law), Alexei Grinbaud (researcher at CEA) and Pierre
    Crozet (lecturer at Sorbonne University) were kind enough to join our little project and introduce different topics
    to our audience. We hope this collaboration between our 3 team will last in time, in the IGEM competition.

  <p>
    In the early phase of the competition we welcomed Celestin from UCL Louvain iGem team at Paris for an entire day.
    More than just a meeting, it It was the perfect time to discuss, and obtain a fresh look on the foundation of our
    respective team’s project.
  </p>
  <p>
    We helped each other on several aspects of the contest such as the human practices and modelling. Our 2 teams would
    had neglected about some iGEM mandatory elements without this meetings.

  <p>
    With Adèle Mazelin and Esteban Lebrun from the Evry Paris Saclay team, we came up with a vulgarization activity in
    senior residence for the science festival, a national scientific group of events.
  </p><p>
    In France, there is a trend to see a negative opinion about GMO especially among the senior population. During this
    day we firstly evaluate bacterial and synthetic biology knowledge of the audience. Surprisingly most of them were
    familiar with fact that bacteria are ubiquitous, and even with the microbiote notion.
</p><p>
    However as usual, synthetic biology and GMO production were seen as an negative “technology” made by agribusiness
    for their own profit. With that reaction in mind, we took the time at the end of the talk to enlight all the issue
    synthetic biology can or as already resolved (with somes examples such as insulin production).
</p><p>
    It was a truly inspiring moment to hear that we changed their opinion against GMO and hope that one day EU laws
    would be more adapted to this interesting field.

  <p>These collaboration would not have been the same without the meetups we attended :</p>

    <p>We were delighted to participate in the iGEM European meet-up in Munich. There we got the chance to present our
      project in its earliest stages to:</p>

    <p>Thanks to this amazing meetup we got the chance to ear about fantastic project happening nearby. It was the first
      poster session for our team and we finished 2nd. After the meetup we stayed in touch we some of the IGEM
      teams.</p>

  <p>The Parisian meetup was the first time we presented our project to all the French teams: Bordeaux, Toulouse,
    Pasteur,
    Evry, Grenoble and Sorbonne University. They gave us some amazing feedback about our project and lots of compliments
    about our presentation. We were blessed to be there, and after this meetup we kept in touch with IGEM Bordeaux,
    Sorbonne and Grenoble.
