    During this 2018 edition, we made fruitful connections with many teams :

    Paris_Saclay is probably the best example of what a real collaboration is. Because our
    team lacked programmers and designers, they proposed to help us with the coding part of IGEM (which really helped us
    in
    creating our wiki), and with the sketching process of our new logo.</p>
  <p>
    We, on the other hand, realized that there was no mathematician in their team. Our two mathematicians proposed to
    work with them on the modelling of their project.

  <p>
    In collaboration with the <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Grenoble-Alpes/Collaborations">IGEM Grenoble Alpes </a>
    team we created the: “Take a famous painting and throw some biology in it
    challenge”. Pictures were posted on social media, the one with the most “likes” wins the competition. A very fun
    challenge indeed, a nice break from the lab during the summer.

  <img src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/0/00/T--GO_Paris-Saclay--collab_postcard.png" class="pmeetup">
  <p>
    We collaborated with <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Duesseldorf/Collaborations">Dusseldorf iGEM steam</a> by
    participating in the design of a postcard showing an image related to synthetic biology associated with a small
    informational text. Each team’s postcards were exchanged with other iGEM-teams so that each team could collect
    postcards from all over the world. The goal is to diffuse the postcard during public events. We chose to put the
    picture of our challenge and a brief description of the Grenoble and the GO Paris-Saclay teams.

    With Sorbonne University and the Bordeaux IGEM team, we organized a Seminar on September 26th on Synthetic Biology.
    Aliaa El Dairouty (PhD student in public law), Alexei Grinbaud (researcher at CEA) and Pierre Crozet (lecturer at
    Sorbonne University) were kind enough to join our project to present different topics to our public. We hope the
    collaboration between the three teams will continue beyond this seminar.

  <p>
    In the early phase of the competition, we welcomed Celestin from UCL Louvain iGEM team in Paris for a day. More than
    just a meeting, it was the perfect time to discuss, and obtain a fresh look on the our respective team’s project.
  </p>
  <p>
    We helped each other on several aspects of the contest such as the human practices and modelling. Our two teams
    would have neglected iGEM mandatory elements without this meeting.

  <p>
    With Adèle Mazelin and Esteban Lebrun from the Evry Paris Saclay team, we came up with a vulgarization activity in
    senior residence for the science festival, a national scientific group of events.
  </p>
  <p>
    In France, GMO are often negatively perceived, especially among the senior population. During this day, we firstly
    evaluated the bacterial and synthetic biology knowledge of the audience. Surprisingly most of them were familiar
    with fact that bacteria are ubiquitous, and even with the microbiote notion.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, as usual, synthetic biology and GMO production were seen as negative “technologies” made by the
    agribusiness for their own profit. We took time to explain the technologies and to enlighten all the issue synthetic
    biology can or as already addressed with examples such as the insulin production.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was a truly inspiring moment to hear that we could change their opinion against GMO. We hope that, in the future,
    EU laws will be more adapted to this promising field.

  <p>These collaboration would not have been the same without the meetups we attended :</p>

    <p>We were delighted to participate to the iGEM European meet-up in Munich. There, we got the chance to present our
      project in its earliest stages to:</p>

    <p>Thanks to this amazing meetup, we got the chance to listen to fantastic projects happening nearby. It was the
      first poster session for our team and we finished 2nd. After the meetup, we stayed in touch with iGEM teams.</p>

    <h1>Parisian meetup</h1></div>
  <p>The Parisian meetup was our first opportunity to present our project to all the French teams: Bordeaux, Toulouse,
    Pasteur, Evry, Grenoble and Sorbonne University. We receive a strong positive feedback on our project and
    congratulation for our presentation. We were happy to be there, and kept in touch with iGEM Bordeaux, Sorbonne and
    Grenoble teams after this meetup.
