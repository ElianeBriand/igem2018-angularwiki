  <p class="withlettrine">
    For MTX biotransformation inside the cell, we focused our attention on two enzymes that have been described as involved
    in MTX biotransformation (Figure 1). The most important one is the Pseudomonas carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2, commercialy marketed
    as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucarpidase">Voraxase</a><sup>tm</sup>)
    which rapidly converts MTX into less toxic metabolites glutamate and <abbr title="2,4-diamino-N10-methylpteroic acid">DAMPA</abbr>
    <reference-box shorthand="Widemann2000"></reference-box><reference-box shorthand="Larimer2014"></reference-box>. We also tested the
    interest of co-expressing a bifunctional
    dihydrofolate synthase and folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (FolC) that could potentially enhance MTX catabolism by coupling
    MTX to polyglutamate<reference-box shorthand="Chabner1985"></reference-box>. By increasing its accumulation within the cell,
    FolC could allow higher effective MTX concentration and reaction rate. We hypothesized that in presence of FolC, the MTX is rapidly
    linked to polyglutamates, a reaction that could increase its metabolism by limiting its export and so that increasing the activity of CPG2.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the MethotrExit project, we introduced in our chassis an expression cassette encoding cpg2 gene under the control
    of lac promoter coupled or not to folC gene under the control of ara promoter.
  </p>

  <h2>Choice of chassis and indicative strains</h2>

  <p>
    Many laboratory strains of E. coli are resistant to MTX. This resistance is mainly due to the export of MTX through
    efflux pumps composed several proteins such as AcrA and TolC <reference-box shorthand="Kopytek2000"></reference-box>. One of the challenges of our
    project therefore relays on limiting MTX efflux to favor MTX biotransformation and sequestration within the ‘cleaning
    factory’. Moreover we needed an indicative strain to easily monitor MTX biotransformation.
  </p><p>
  We decided to take advantage of the availability in our lab of the Keio collection <reference-box shorthand="Baba2006"></reference-box> to test the
  growth of several E. coli K12 mutants (&Delta;acrA1, &Delta;acrB, &Delta;abgT, &Delta;tolC) in presence of MTX (Figure 2).

        Bacteria were precultured overnight in 4 ml of LB under agitation at 37°C. Thereafter, the samples were diluted in LB medium to obtain an initial OD<sub>600nm</sub> of 0.02
        (in a final volume of 100 µl) in presence of 2% DMSO (co-solvent) or 64 to 1024 µM MTX (kindly provided by Raphaël Labruère).
        Bacteria suspensions were inoculated in a 96-well plate, covered with an adhesive transparent top to avoid evaporation. Bacteria
        were grown at 37°C in a Clariostar® plate reader (BMG LABtech GmbH), with orbital shaking, measuring OD<sub>600</sub> every 20 min. The experiments
        were carried out during at least 6 h (sufficient to reach stationary phase)</div>

  <p>
    We observed that the BW25113 WT strain is MTX-resistant as previously described for many E. coli laboratory strains.
    Interestingly, ΔacrA1 and ΔtolC strains are sensitive to MTX (at least 128 µM), suggesting that MTX may be accumulated
    within these strains. Surprisingly, the ∆acrB strain growth does not present any MTX ‘dose-response’ pattern, indicating
    that AcrB is not required to resist to MTX. Of note, ΔtolC mutant present a slight growth defect compared to the WT strain
    even in absence of LB, suggesting that TolC is required for efflux of compounds even in standard growth conditions.
  </p>
  <p class="intermediateconclusion">
    Main conclusions: The WT strain may constitute a suitable ‘MTX-resistant chassis’, whereas ΔacrA1 and ΔtolC strains could constitute MTX-sensitive indicative
    strains as well as chassis accumulating MTX. Since TolC is a general efflux pump component involved in a large panel of compound efflux
    (even in standard LB growth conditions), we thought it could be interesting to also evaluate its general interest as a chassis sequestrating MTX
    (and possibly other toxic molecules). Finally, the ΔacrA1 mutant was used as an indicative strain for further bioassays since it presents no growth
    defect in absence of MTX.

  <p>
    <b>FolC/folylpolyglutamate: adding a polyglutamate to MTX</b><br>
    FolC is one of the enzymes (ATP-dependent) which can drive the glutamylation reaction. FolC is naturally encoded by E. coli.
    However to control and overexpress it, we cloned folC under the control of the ara inducible promoter in pSB1C3.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Carboxypeptidase G2: breaking MTX into DAMPA and glutamate</b><br>
    Originating from Pseudomonas strain RS-16, carboxypeptidase is not naturally present in E. coli genome.
    The cpg2 gene was cloned within pSB1C3 under the control of lac
    inducible promoter. We constructed two plasmids: one containing only cpg2 expression cassette and the other harboring both cpg2
    and folC expression cassettes separated by a transcription terminator (Figure 3).

    The translation units in this expression vector were synthetized separately, courtesy of IDT, then assembled using standard biobrick assembly.

  <p>
    To determine whether our ‘Cleaning Factories’ (WT and &Delta;tolC strains harboring cpg2 with or without folC expression cassette)
    were able to biotransform MTX, we performed the following experiments:
